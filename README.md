# abg_python

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/agurvich/abg_python.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/agurvich/abg_python)
[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/abg_python)](https://pypi.org/project/abg_python)

Some Python utilities common to a lot of my packages and repositories (perhaps most notably [FIREstudio](https://github.com/agurvich/FIRE_studio) and, in part, [Firefly](https://github.com/ageller/Firefly)).

If you use any part of this code for direct calculation please put a nice thank you in your acknowledgements ("Some of the calculations presented in this work rely on public code developed by Alex Gurvich, available at github.com/agurvich/abg_python" or something like that). If you use it as a dependency for something else I've built, acknowledge that codebase instead (e.g. FIRE studio or Firefly). 

## Installation
 `abg_python` is available from PyPi by
 ```bash
 pip install abg_python
 ```
 
 or you can build the source yourself by cloning this repository and, from the top level directory, executing
 ```bash
 pip install -e .
 ```
