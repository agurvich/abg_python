common python utilities

If you use any part of this code for direct calculation please put a nice thank you in your acknowledgements ("Some of the calculations presented in this work rely on public code developed by Alex Gurvich, available at github.com/agurvich/abg_python" or something like that, feel free to reach out). If you use it as a dependency for something else I've built, acknowledge that codebase instead (e.g. FIRE studio or Firefly). 

## Installation
You should install this package by cloning the repository into your PYTHONPATH and referencing the scripts here by `abg_python.snapshot_utils`! That way you can update when I fix the inevitable bug and I don't have to feel bad :]
